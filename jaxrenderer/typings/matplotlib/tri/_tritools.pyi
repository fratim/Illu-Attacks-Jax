class TriAnalyzer:
    """
    Define basic tools for triangular mesh analysis and improvement.

    A TriAnalyzer encapsulates a `.Triangulation` object and provides basic
    tools for mesh analysis and mesh improvement.

    Attributes
    ----------
    scale_factors

    Parameters
    ----------
    triangulation : `~matplotlib.tri.Triangulation`
        The encapsulated triangulation to analyze.

    @property
    def scale_factors(self):  # -> tuple[Unknown, Unknown]:
        """
        Factors to rescale the triangulation into a unit square.

        Returns
        -------
        (float, float)
            Scaling factors (kx, ky) so that the triangulation
            ``[triangulation.x * kx, triangulation.y * ky]``
            fits exactly inside a unit square.

        ...
    def circle_ratios(self, rescale=...):  # -> NDArray[floating[Any]]:
        """
        Return a measure of the triangulation triangles flatness.

        The ratio of the incircle radius over the circumcircle radius is a
        widely used indicator of a triangle flatness.
        It is always ``<= 0.5`` and ``== 0.5`` only for equilateral
        triangles. Circle ratios below 0.01 denote very flat triangles.

        To avoid unduly low values due to a difference of scale between the 2
        axis, the triangular mesh can first be rescaled to fit inside a unit
        square with `scale_factors` (Only if *rescale* is True, which is
        its default value).

        Parameters
        ----------
        rescale : bool, default: True
            If True, internally rescale (based on `scale_factors`), so that the
            (unmasked) triangles fit exactly inside a unit square mesh.

        Returns
        -------
        masked array
            Ratio of the incircle radius over the circumcircle radius, for
            each 'rescaled' triangle of the encapsulated triangulation.
            Values corresponding to masked triangles are masked out.

        """
        ...
    def get_flat_tri_mask(self, min_circle_ratio=..., rescale=...):
        """
        Eliminate excessively flat border triangles from the triangulation.

        Returns a mask *new_mask* which allows to clean the encapsulated
        triangulation from its border-located flat triangles
        (according to their :meth:`circle_ratios`).
        This mask is meant to be subsequently applied to the triangulation
        using `.Triangulation.set_mask`.
        *new_mask* is an extension of the initial triangulation mask
        in the sense that an initially masked triangle will remain masked.

        The *new_mask* array is computed recursively; at each step flat
        triangles are removed only if they share a side with the current mesh
        border. Thus, no new holes in the triangulated domain will be created.

        Parameters
        ----------
        min_circle_ratio : float, default: 0.01
            Border triangles with incircle/circumcircle radii ratio r/R will
            be removed if r/R < *min_circle_ratio*.
        rescale : bool, default: True
            If True, first, internally rescale (based on `scale_factors`) so
            that the (unmasked) triangles fit exactly inside a unit square
            mesh.  This rescaling accounts for the difference of scale which
            might exist between the 2 axis.

        Returns
        -------
        array of bool
            Mask to apply to encapsulated triangulation.
            All the initially masked triangles remain masked in the
            *new_mask*.

        Notes
        -----
        The rationale behind this function is that a Delaunay
        triangulation - of an unstructured set of points - sometimes contains
        almost flat triangles at its border, leading to artifacts in plots
        (especially for high-resolution contouring).
        Masked with computed *new_mask*, the encapsulated
        triangulation would contain no more unmasked border triangles
        with a circle ratio below *min_circle_ratio*, thus improving the
        mesh quality for subsequent plots or interpolation.
